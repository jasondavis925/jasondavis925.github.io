This is my attempt to develop a website.

By Jason Davis Â· [Demo]

PURPOSE: Quickly build good webpages to develop personal sites, blogs and simple projects.

The Basic site includes:

Configure file and title _config.yml

Add Title of first blog index.html _layout/home.html _layout/page.html

Add Style _layout/base.html _include/head.html _include/header.html _include/footer.html _include/footer-minimal.html

STEP ONE _Config File Add _config.yml file and insert a line of code to add a title:

STEP TWO - Blog Title To establish the first blog title, include a file called index.html that calls _layout/home.html and page.html. These files overwrite the _config file content.

STEP THREE - Add Style
