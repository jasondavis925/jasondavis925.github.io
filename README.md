This is my attempt to develop a website.

By Jason Davis Â· [Demo]

PURPOSE: Build a good webpage quickly to develop personal sites, blogs and simple projects.

STEP ONE Add _config.yml file and insert a line of code to add a title:

STEP TWO - include a file called index.html that calls _layout/home.html and page.html. These files overwrite the _config file content.

STEP THREE - Add Style _layout/base.html _include/head.html _include/header.html _include/footer.html _include/footer-minimal.html


Blog Title To establish the first blog title, Add Title of first blog index.html _layout/home.html _layout/page.html
